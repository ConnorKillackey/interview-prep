    // problems to work through
    // fisher yates shuffle (get a random element to put at that index)

    // window sliding problem, largest sum of n consecutive numbers

    // longest common subsequence

    // find triplet sum, same as zero sum

    // smallest subarray with sum greater than given input

    // merging two sorted arrays

    // min and max of unsorted array

    // quadruples

    // longest sequence of increasing numbers

    // finding maximum subarray sum (similar to Kadane's Algorithm) with the constraint that two numbers in the array that form the max sum cannot be next to each other.

    // Given a sorted array, write a program to decide if two elements sum up to a third.  

    // Given an array of positive ints and an integer K, determine if a subsequence in the array sums to K. Solve in linear time.  

    // contiguous subsets
